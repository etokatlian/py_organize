automated file organization
---

### My downloads folder is a mess. This python script listens for changes in my filesystem's download dir and automatically organizes all incoming downloads into categorized dirs on my desktop. 

#### i.e.: 
- I download a .txt file from some website. Instead of cluttering up my downloads dir, it gets organized into `/Users/erictokatlian/organized_downloads/txt`
- Next I download some pdf files, all of those will get organized into `/Users/erictokatlian/organized_downloads/pdf`
